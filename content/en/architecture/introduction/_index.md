The Aurora Platform (AUR) represents a strategic evolution of the Cloud Native Platform (CNP), originally developed at Statistics Canada to provide a unified application hosting platform. Recognizing its broader potential, Shared Services Canada (SSC) is leading efforts to expand its adoption across the Government of Canada.

To unlock Aurora’s full potential, active collaboration from multiple departments is crucial. By working together, departments can contribute to refining and advancing the platform, ensuring it remains scalable, adaptable, and responsive to a wide range of needs.

This collective effort will enhance Aurora’s capabilities, enabling it to meet the diverse and complex requirements of federal stakeholders while supporting interoperability and driving innovation across the public sector.

## Core Pillars of Aurora

The Aurora Platform (AUR) is built on four core pillars:

- **Compute**: Delivering scalable, on-demand resources for processing workloads.
- **Networking**: Enabling secure and reliable communication across services, systems, and clouds.
- **Storage/Persistence**: Ensuring data durability, availability, and performance for both short-lived and persistent data.
- **Security**: Implementing robust identity, access control, and threat mitigation strategies to safeguard data and workloads.

These pillars create a flexible, scalable foundation to support diverse workloads across the Government of Canada.
