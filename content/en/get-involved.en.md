At **GC Cloud One: Aurora**, we’re building a collaborative community around cloud-native technologies, and we encourage everyone to get involved! Whether you’re a seasoned Kubernetes expert or new to the platform, there are multiple ways to contribute, learn, and grow together. Here’s how you can get started:

## Join our meetups

We regularly host meetups focused on sharing best practices, discussing new features, and addressing real-world challenges. These meetups are a great way to meet fellow developers who are actively building and deploying on Aurora’s platform.

- **What to Expect**: Lightning talks, hands-on workshops, and Q&A sessions on topics like Kubernetes networking, security (e.g., zero trust), and multi-cloud deployments.
- **How to Join**: Follow our gcxchange <gcds-link external href="https://gcxgce.sharepoint.com/teams/10002412">Aurora community</gcds-link> (GC Network) to find upcoming meetups and register to attend.
- **Virtual & In-Person**: We offer both virtual and in-person meetups to make it accessible to participants across various regions.

## Attend hackathons

Looking for hands-on experience? Participate in our hackathons, where you’ll work on real-world challenges related to Kubernetes, and cloud-native technologies. These events bring together teams of developers to innovate and build solutions that directly benefit our platform.

- **Focus Areas**: Automation, scaling workloads, security integration, and improving developer experience on Aurora.
- **Who Should Attend**: Developers, DevOps engineers, and security professionals interested in learning by doing.

## Contribute to open source projects

Aurora leverages open-source projects from the Kubernetes and CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) ecosystems. You can contribute to these projects or even propose enhancements to the Aurora platform itself. We welcome contributions in areas such as:

- **Documentation**: Help improve our platform’s user guides and tutorials.
- **Code Contributions**: Work on issues, propose new features, or fix bugs in our GitHub <gcds-link external href="https://github.com/gccloudone">GC Cloud One</gcds-link> organization.
- **Platform Feedback**: Share your insights and suggestions for improving the Aurora platform in our public discussions.

## Participate in SIGs

Join one of our **Special Interest Groups (SIGs)** to dive deeper into specific technical areas like architecture, security, and networking. Each SIG meets regularly to collaborate on initiatives, set standards, and address ongoing challenges in these domains.

- **SIG: Architecture**: Focus on platform design, scalability, and cloud-native best practices.
- **SIG: Security**: Work on policies, zero trust security, and defense-in-depth strategies.
- **SIG: Networking**: Dive into topics like service meshes, eBPF, and multi-cluster networking.
