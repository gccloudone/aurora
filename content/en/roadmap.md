## 2026 Platform Themes

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

<ol class="list-disc ps-400 mb-300">
  <li>Operate a unified application hosting platform across public cloud and GC Private Cloud environments</li>
  <li>Build sustainable platform practices that reduce cognitive load for both platform and application teams</li>
  <li>Enable departments through a community-driven, CNCF-aligned platform with clear guardrails and autonomy</li>
</ol>

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

The roadmap below highlights the major platform epics and strategic initiatives planned or already in progress for Aurora in 2026.

Items are grouped by quarter to provide directional visibility into how work is expected to progress across the year, while allowing the flexibility required to operate a shared, enterprise-scale platform.

Each quarter reflects a concentration of effort rather than a fixed commitment to delivery dates.

## Change is expected

Aurora is a living platform shaped by departmental demand, security requirements, operational maturity, and lessons learned through real-world adoption.

Our product roadmap can change based on shifting priorities, resource availability, and unforeseen dependencies. Any item that has not yet started may be reprioritized or replaced by a higher-value initiative. Items currently in progress could be delayed as we navigate challenges and learn along the way.

We share this roadmap to foster transparency, encourage collaboration, and align with our stakeholders. We welcome your feedback and contributions as we refine our path forward.
