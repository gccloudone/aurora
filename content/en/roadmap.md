## Change is expected

Our roadmap may evolve based on shifting priorities, departmental demand, security requirements, and operational realities. Items not yet started may be reprioritized or replaced as higher-value opportunities emerge.

We share this roadmap to promote transparency, alignment, and collaboration across the Government of Canada cloud-native community.
