For the Aurora TAG (Technical Architecture Group) to operate effectively within the Government of Canada (GoC) and Shared Services Canada (SSC) context, it is essential to clearly define roles and responsibilities. This guide maps GoC job classifications to key roles within Aurora TAG, ensuring that each participant understands their duties, expected contributions, and decision-making authority.

Having well-defined roles ensures that:

- TAG members understand their scope of influence and expectations.
- Meetings are productive, structured, and focused on decision-making.
- Responsibilities are distributed fairly across the group.
- The TAG’s work aligns with GoC governance and decision-making frameworks.

This guide helps Aurora TAG function as a collaborative, efficient, and accountable architecture body.

## Key Roles in Aurora TAG

### 1. Executive Sponsor / Champion (Optional, but Recommended)

Example GoC Title: Director or Director General (EX-01/02 or equivalent IT-05/06)

This is a senior executive-level role that provides strategic oversight and advocacy for the TAG. While not involved in day-to-day activities, the Executive Sponsor:

- Charters the TAG – Approves its mandate, objectives, and governance structure.
- Removes roadblocks – Helps clear obstacles that the TAG cannot resolve independently.
- Escalation point – Steps in when decisions go beyond the TAG’s authority or require higher-level intervention.
- Champions TAG recommendations – Ensures architectural decisions are heard at senior governance forums (e.g., Architecture Boards, SSC leadership).

In Aurora’s context, this role could be held by an Assistant Director, Director, or a senior SSC official who has oversight over the TAG’s domain.

### 2. TAG Chair (Lead)

Example GoC Title: IT-04 / CS-04/05 (Senior Architect, Manager, or EX-minus-1 equivalent)

The TAG Chair is the primary leader and ensures that the group remains focused, organized, and aligned with its mandate. This role requires deep technical expertise, leadership skills, and governance awareness.

#### Key Responsibilities

- Facilitates and convenes TAG meetings – Schedules meetings, sets agendas, and ensures effective discussions.
- Chairs discussions – Keeps conversations on track, ensures all voices are heard, and summarizes decisions.
- Drives decision-making – Ensures that outcomes and action items are clear, documented, and assigned.
- Oversees documentation – Ensures meeting minutes, decisions, and technical records are properly maintained (though they may delegate note-taking).
- Follows up on action items – Tracks progress and ensures commitments are met between meetings.
- Represents the TAG externally – Provides updates to higher governance forums, stakeholders, and sponsors.

#### Chair Term and Rotation Policy (If Applicable)

- The Chair may rotate every 6-12 months, or
- The role may remain fixed, with a deputy (Co-Chair) as backup.
- If rotating, the process should be documented and agreed upon to ensure continuity.

---

### 3. Co-Chair / Vice-Chair

Example GoC Title: IT-04 / CS-04 (Senior Architect or Technical Lead)

The Co-Chair serves as a backup leader and supports the Chair in running the TAG. This ensures continuity if the Chair is unavailable and provides an additional point of leadership within the group.

#### Key Responsibilities

- Steps in for the Chair when needed – Chairs meetings if the Chair is absent.
- Supports meeting facilitation – Manages timekeeping, ensures discussions remain productive.
- Handles specific administrative or governance tasks (if assigned).
- May coordinate meeting logistics, such as sending invites, tracking attendance, or organizing documentation.

How the Co-Chair is selected should be clearly defined (e.g., appointed by the Chair or selected by TAG members).

### 4. TAG Members

Example GoC Titles:

- Solution Architects (CS-04, IT-03/04)
- Technical Advisors (CS-04, IT-03/04)
- Senior Developers (CS-03, IT-03)
- Security Architects (CS-04, IT-04/05)

TAG members are technical experts who actively contribute to architecture discussions and decisions. Their expertise shapes Aurora’s architectural evolution.

While the IT-03 / IT-04 distinction is illustrative of general role expectations, in practice, individuals may take on higher responsibilities based on expertise and project needs.

#### Key Responsibilities

- Attend meetings regularly and contribute to discussions.
- Provide technical expertise – Share insights and best practices related to cloud, security, infrastructure, and application architecture.
- Complete assigned action items – Take ownership of deliverables and meet deadlines.
- Follow GoC policies and governance frameworks – Ensure compliance with security, privacy, and technical guidelines.
- Prepare for meetings – Review agenda items and relevant documents beforehand.
- Champion proposals – Members may lead drafting an AEP (Architectural Enhancement Proposal) in their area of expertise.

#### Active Participation and Continuity

- Members should be engaged and responsive – CNCF TAGs emphasize that inactive members should step back or be temporarily replaced.
- If a member takes extended leave or changes roles, they should notify the Chair and identify a delegate if needed.

### 5. Secretariat / Coordinator (If Available)

Example GoC Title: Administrative Officer (AS-02/03) or Team Coordinator

If Aurora TAG has administrative support, this role helps with meeting logistics and documentation.

#### Key Responsibilities

- Schedules meetings – On behalf of the Chair.
- Manages email lists and communication channels.
- Prepares meeting agendas and circulates materials.
- Takes meeting minutes – Ensures records are accurate and up to date.
- Maintains documentation repositories – Organizes files in SharePoint, Confluence, or Git repositories.

In smaller TAGs, these responsibilities may be handled by the Chair or Co-Chair instead.

### 6. Observers and Advisors (Non-Voting Participants, If Applicable)

Some TAG meetings may include non-voting observers or advisors, such as:

- Policy authorities (e.g., SSC compliance leads, security officers)
- External consultants (if engaged on specific projects)

#### Rules for Observers

- May contribute to discussions by invitation but do not participate in votes.
- Attend specific meetings as needed, based on the agenda.
- Help inform architectural decisions with specialized expertise.

## Governance and Conduct Expectations

All TAG members must adhere to the Government of Canada’s Values and Ethics Code and conflict of interest policies.

Best Practices:

✔ Declare conflicts of interest at the start of discussions (e.g., if involved in a procurement related to the topic).

✔ Uphold professional and respectful discourse during meetings.

✔ Follow GoC confidentiality policies where applicable.

Maintaining these standards ensures the integrity of Aurora TAG’s decision-making process.
