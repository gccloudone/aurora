For Aurora TAG to function effectively, it is essential to establish clear membership criteria and attendance expectations. These guidelines ensure that:

- The right mix of expertise is present for informed decision-making.
- Members actively participate, keeping discussions meaningful and productive.
- The TAG remains stable and accountable, even when personnel changes occur.
- Decisions reflect broad representation, rather than being made by a small subset of members.

This document outlines how members are selected, their obligations, and processes for handling absences or membership changes.

---

## 1. Composition and Size of Aurora TAG

- The TAG will include 8-12 core members, ensuring a balance of perspectives while remaining small enough for efficient discussions.
- The TAG should have representation from key disciplines such as:
    - Cloud and Infrastructure (e.g., Solution Architects, DevOps Leads)
    - Security and Compliance (e.g., Security Architects, Cybersecurity Specialists)
    - Operations and Governance (e.g., Enterprise Architects, SSC representatives)
    - Application and Development (e.g., Senior Developers, Technical Leads)
- Additional subject-matter experts (SMEs) or advisors may be invited as needed, but they will not have voting rights.

---

## 2. Membership Appointment Process

- Who Approves Membership?
    - The TAG Sponsor (Director or AD-level official) or TAG Chair is responsible for approving new members.
    - New members should be nominated based on skills, expertise, and relevance to Aurora’s mission.
- Term Lengths and Membership Refresh
    - TAG membership is generally ongoing but may be reviewed annually or at project phase transitions.
    - If Aurora TAG is project-specific, membership may last for the duration of the project.
- Replacing Departing Members
    - If a member leaves or changes roles, the Chair/Sponsor may nominate a replacement with similar expertise.

---

## 3. Onboarding New Members

- New members will be provided with:
    - The Aurora TAG Charter
    - The last 3-6 months of meeting minutes
    - Any background documentation (architecture guidelines, past decisions, key proposals)
- Mentorship – When possible, new members should be paired with an existing TAG member to accelerate onboarding.

---

## 4. Attendance Expectations

- Members must regularly attend meetings and actively engage in discussions.
- Minimum Attendance Requirement:
    - Members should attend at least 75% of scheduled meetings over any given quarter.
    - If a member misses three consecutive meetings without prior notice, their membership may be reviewed.
- Absences and Regrets:
    - If a member cannot attend, they should:
    ✔ Notify the Chair/Co-Chair in advance.
    ✔ Review meeting minutes afterward to stay informed.
- Active Participation Matters:
    - Members are expected to contribute technical expertise and follow through on assigned action items.
    - In CNCF TAGs, inactive members are removed to keep groups engaged. Aurora TAG follows a similar principle—inactive members may be rotated out to maintain effectiveness.

---

## 5. Delegates and Proxies

- Delegates may be allowed in exceptional cases to ensure representation.
- If a member is unavailable, they may send a delegate (from their team or discipline) to:
✔ Observe discussions and report back.
✔ Participate in discussions if invited by the Chair.
- Voting rights remain with the core member, even if a delegate attends.

---

## 6. Extended Leaves and Resignations

- If a member will be on extended leave (e.g., parental leave, long-term training, or assignment elsewhere), they should:
✔ Inform the Chair in advance.
✔ Nominate a temporary replacement if necessary.
- Members may resign voluntarily if they feel they cannot contribute effectively.
    - Resignation should be communicated to the Chair so a replacement can be identified.

---

## 7. Membership Review Process

- Membership will be formally reviewed annually, or at key milestones (e.g., project phases).
- Possible reasons for review:
    - Expertise needs change – If Aurora TAG’s focus shifts, new expertise may be required.
    - Prolonged inactivity – If a member is disengaged, their role may be reassessed.
    - Expansion or restructuring – Additional members may be onboarded if new challenges arise.
- If a membership disagreement occurs (e.g., a contested appointment), the Chair and Sponsor will decide.

---

## 8. Quorum for Meetings and Decision-Making

- What is Quorum?
    - A minimum of 50% of core voting members must be present for a meeting to be official.
    - A minimum of 5 members (including the Chair or Co-Chair) is required to hold a formal vote.
- If Quorum is Not Met:
    - The meeting may still proceed, but formal decisions should be deferred.
- Voting Rights
    - Only core members (not observers or delegates) may vote on decisions.
    - Consensus is preferred, but if a formal vote is needed, a ⅔ majority is required for approval.

---

## 9. Conflict of Interest and Objectivity

- TAG members must act in the best interest of Aurora and the GoC.
- If a member has a conflict of interest (e.g., they are responsible for a tool under discussion), they must:
-  Declare the conflict before discussions begin.
- Recuse themselves from voting if necessary.
- This ensures that TAG decisions remain unbiased and credible.

---

## 10. Removing a TAG Member (Rare, but necessary in some cases)

- Members may be removed if they:
    - Fail to participate over an extended period.
    - Repeatedly miss meetings without notice.
    - Are unable to fulfill their TAG duties for any reason.
    - Lose the confidence of the group due to conflicts, lack of engagement, or other concerns.
- Process for Removal:
    - A discussion between the Chair and Sponsor will determine if removal is necessary.
    - If required, the TAG will vote on the decision, or the Sponsor will appoint a replacement.
    - This process follows CNCF TAG best practices, where inactive members can be removed by a super-majority vote of the Chairs.
