**Date:** March 26th, 2025
**Location:** [Virtual/In-Person]  
**Presenter:** William Hearn (Senior Cloud Architect, GC Cloud One)  
**Attendees:** ARC Members
**Objective:** Review the Aurora initiative and secure approval for its **strategic direction and technical architecture**.

## 1. Executive Summary

### **Context**

The **Aurora Initiative** is a **unified application hosting platform** designed to standardize **managed Kubernetes cloud offerings** across the GC. It integrates **both proprietary (OpenShift) and OSS (Cloud Native Kubernetes) environments**, drawing from operational experience in the **Cloud Native Platform (CNP)**.

### **Why Now?**

- Current departmental cloud-native strategies are **disjointed, costly, and redundant**.
- Aurora provides a **governance framework** that reduces inefficiencies, promotes **multi-cloud standardization**, and aligns with SSC’s **GC Cloud One** strategy.
- The initiative has **received broad buy-in** from multiple departments and aligns with similar government initiatives (BC Gov DevOps, Platform One, etc.).

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

### **2.1 Technical Architecture**

- **Core Services:** Kubernetes (AKS, EKS, GKE, OpenShift)
- **Networking:** Cilium + BGP (BIRD with route reflectors)
- **Security Model:** Zero Trust, Gatekeeper (OPA), SCED for on-prem connectivity
- **CI/CD:** GitLab Runners, Crossplane for cloud resource automation
- **Observability:** Loki, Prometheus
- **Multi-Tenancy Approach:** Namespaced isolation, policy enforcement

#### **Key Benefits**

✔️ **Unified API surface** for Kubernetes adoption across SSC.  
✔️ **Flexible deployment models** (OSS and proprietary).  
✔️ **Security-first** approach (zero trust, policy-driven enforcement).  
✔️ **Interoperability** with existing departmental solutions.

---

## 3. Governance & Compliance Alignment

- Aurora **adheres to SSC’s cloud governance model**, ensuring **interoperability, security, and standardization**.
- Leverages **CNCF best practices** for operational maturity.
- Supports **multi-tenancy, workload separation, and automated compliance checks**.
- Aligns with **Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) cloud directives**.

### **Key Decision Point for ARC**

✔️ Does Aurora meet SSC’s **interoperability and security requirements**?

---

## 4. Operational Model

### **4.1 Deployment Approach**

Aurora will be deployed in SSC’s **Enterprise Tenant**, with:

- **Two main environments:** `AuroraNonProd` (mgmt-dev-cc-00) and `AuroraProd` (mgmt-prod-cc-00).
- Integration with **Fortigate Firewalls** for automated rule management.
- Centralized **GitOps pipeline** (Argo CD) for policy-based application deployment.

### **4.2 Team Structure**

- **Architecture & Governance Team**: Defines standards and compliance.
- **Platform Operations Team**: Maintains core services (GitLab, Vault, Artifactory).
- **Advisory SIGs (Architecture, Networking, Security)**: Drives technical decisions.

### **Key Decision Point for ARC**

✔️ Does this operational model align with SSC’s cloud-native strategy?

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

| **Risk**                           | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Departments resist standardization | Aurora allows **flexible adoption** while enforcing key governance policies.                      |
| OSS vs Proprietary Tensions        | Supports **both managed OpenShift and Kubernetes**, providing departments with options.           |
| Security & Compliance Overhead     | **Automated policy enforcement** via Gatekeeper, OPA, and workload isolation.                     |
| Multi-cloud Complexity             | **Standardized onboarding, automated provisioning**, and governance frameworks reduce complexity. |

### **Key Decision Point for ARC**

✔️ Are these risk mitigation strategies sufficient for ARC approval?

---

## 6. Next Steps & Approval Criteria

### **Decision Framework for ARC**

1. Approve Aurora’s **technical architecture and governance model**.
2. Endorse **standardization strategy** for Kubernetes-based cloud workloads.
3. Provide feedback on **multi-cloud policy enforcement**.
4. Identify **any blockers or additional concerns** before proceeding to full rollout.

### **Proposed Next Actions**

✅ **Endorsement** of Aurora’s architecture and governance framework.  
✅ **Pilot onboarding** of departments to validate deployment and support model.  
✅ **Monthly ARC updates** on progress and security reviews.
