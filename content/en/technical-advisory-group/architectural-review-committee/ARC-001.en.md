## 1. Executive Summary

### Context

The Aurora initiative is a universal platform for modern application hosting designed to standardize managed Kubernetes cloud offerings across the Government of Canada.

Aurora is a secure, self-service (application) hosting platform that enables solution builders to rapidly develop and deploy cloud-native solutions.

### Why Now?

Aurora emerges at a pivotal moment, as SSC centralizes cloud teams under the new **GC Cloud One** initiative—providing the structure needed to unify fragmented efforts and scale a shared approach to cloud service delivery across government.

- Departmental cloud strategies remain fragmented, **increasing cognitive load**, duplication of effort, and overall costs
- A consistent **governance framework** is needed to reduce inefficiencies, promote **multi-cloud standardization**, and align with SSC’s **GC Cloud One** strategy
- **Security, compliance, and technical debt** create delivery bottlenecks—manual processes, inconsistent controls, and unmanaged infrastructure increase risk and slow time-to-value
- **Kubernetes adoption** remains challenging due to the lack of a shared platform, onboarding standards, and operational guardrails
- A shift toward **platform engineering** is gaining momentum—departments are adopting unified platforms that embed governance, security, and self-service capabilities by design

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Technical Architecture

Aurora is not a Kubernetes distribution—it is a composable set of add-on components that transform any managed Kubernetes environment into a full-featured, secure, and scalable application hosting platform. Built atop existing cloud-managed services such as AKS, EKS, GKE, and OpenShift, Aurora provides the foundational services, governance controls, and developer experience enhancements required to support modern, multi-tenant workloads across the Government of Canada.

Aurora includes a curated, opinionated configuration of cloud-native components and Kubernetes resources aligned to Government of Canada requirements—balancing developer self-service with strong security, compliance, and operational guardrails.

- **Base Platform:** Cloud-managed Kubernetes offerings (AKS, EKS, GKE, OpenShift)
- **Networking Layer:** Cilium with BGP (BIRD + route reflectors) and namespace-level network policies for tenant isolation
- **Security Model:** Zero Trust architecture, Gatekeeper (OPA) for policy enforcement, SCED integration for on-prem connectivity
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** GitLab Runners integrated with Argo CD for GitOps-based delivery
- **Observability Stack:** Prometheus, Loki, and centralized logging/metrics forwarding
- **Multi-Tenancy Approach:** Namespaced resource boundaries, enforced network isolation, and RBAC + policy guardrails

#### Key Benefits

✔️ **Unified API surface** for Kubernetes adoption across the GC
✔️ **Opinionated configuration** that aligns with GC policies and standards
✔️ **Security-first**, with embedded zero trust and governance by default
✔️ **Interoperable** with existing departmental infrastructure
✔️ **Flexible deployment models**, supporting both OSS and proprietary tooling
✔️ **Strong tenant isolation** via namespace boundaries and enforced network segmentation
✔️ **Self-service within policy boundaries**, empowering teams while ensuring compliance

### 2.2 Policy-Driven Model

Aurora enables developer autonomy while enforcing non-negotiable guardrails. The platform uses **Gatekeeper (OPA)** and curated policies to ensure all workloads adhere to GC-wide compliance, security, and operational requirements—without the need for manual reviews or central bottlenecks.

By codifying these constraints, Aurora empowers application teams to build, deploy, and manage their solutions independently, while staying within clearly defined, enforceable limits. This **“freedom within boundaries”** model reduces cognitive load on platform and security teams while increasing delivery velocity for application teams.

## 3. Governance & Compliance Alignment

The Aurora initiative is supported by the newly established **Technical Advisory Group (TAG)**—a cross-departmental body that provides architectural oversight, technical guidance, and ensures continuous alignment with Government of Canada priorities. Governed by a published **charter, roles, and responsibilities**, the TAG enables community-driven governance and helps shape the platform’s evolution through shared stewardship.

- Aurora **adheres to SSC’s cloud governance model**, ensuring **interoperability, security, and standardization**
- Leverages **CNCF best practices** for operational maturity
- Supports **multi-tenancy, workload separation, and automated compliance checks**
- Aligns with **Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) cloud directives**

### Key Decision Point for ARC

✔️ Does Aurora meet SSC’s **interoperability and security requirements**?
✔️ Is the **Technical Advisory Group (TAG)** recognized as a valid mechanism for cross-departmental technical governance?

## 4. Operational Model

Aurora’s operational model reflects a scalable, multi-environment architecture grounded in platform engineering principles. It is designed to centralize operational overhead, reduce duplication across departments, and enable secure, self-service cloud-native development at scale. The model supports both shared services and per-department configurations, enabling a flexible yet governed path for onboarding departments of all sizes.

### 4.1 Deployment Approach

Aurora will be deployed in SSC’s **Enterprise Tenant**, with:

- **Two main platform environments** for cluster provisioning and platform services:
  - `AuroraNonProd` (`mgmt-dev-cc-00`)
  - `AuroraProd` (`mgmt-prod-cc-00`)
- Integration with **Fortigate Firewalls**, using metadata-driven rulesets to restrict inter-cluster communication and ensure workload isolation, managed entirely as Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Centralized **GitOps pipelines (Argo CD)** for deploying and enforcing platform-level policies across all Aurora clusters

### 4.2 Supporting Services and Management Clusters

In addition to the platform clusters above, the Aurora model includes several **supporting service layers**:

- **Development Services Environments** (NonProd and Prod): Dedicated to hosting shared services like **Artifactory**, **X-Ray**, **Backstage**, and others critical to Aurora's developer experience
- **[Planned] Shared Management Cluster**: A centralized Argo CD environment to orchestrate deployment pipelines and policy enforcement across all Aurora clusters.
  - *Problem to solve:* Ensuring secure, scalable **connectivity from this management plane to all clusters** across both the Enterprise Tenant and departmental landing zones
- **[Planned] Shared SDLC Environments**: Hosted in the Enterprise Tenant, enabling **small departments and agencies** to access secure CI/CD pipelines and runtime environments without managing their own clusters
- **[Planned] Per-Department SDLC Clusters**: Deployed either in the **Enterprise Tenant** (preferred) or **departmental tenants**, with connectivity to departmental landing zones. These clusters allow departments with more advanced needs to onboard in a governed but autonomous manner

### 4.3 Team Structure

To support and operate this model, Aurora introduces clearly defined roles:

- **Architecture & Governance Team**: Defines technical standards, compliance boundaries, and platform blueprints
- **Platform Operations Team**: Manages the lifecycle of core horizontal services (e.g., GitLab, Vault, Artifactory, CI/CD)
- **Advisory TAGs** (*Architecture*, *Networking*, *Security*): Serve as expert panels to guide technical decisions, validate designs, and drive community alignment

### Key Decision Point for ARC

✔️ Does this operational model align with SSC’s cloud-native strategy?
✔️ Does the structure support long-term scalability across departments and tenants?

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

| **Risk**                           | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Departments resist standardization | Aurora allows **flexible adoption** while enforcing key governance policies.                      |
| OSS vs Proprietary Tensions        | Supports **both managed OpenShift and Kubernetes**, providing departments with options.           |
| Security & Compliance Overhead     | **Automated policy enforcement** via Gatekeeper, OPA, and workload isolation.                     |
| Multi-cloud Complexity             | **Standardized onboarding, automated provisioning**, and governance frameworks reduce complexity. |

### Key Decision Point for ARC

✔️ Are these risk mitigation strategies sufficient for ARC approval?
