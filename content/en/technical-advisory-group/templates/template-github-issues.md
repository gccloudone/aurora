To effectively manage the work of the Aurora Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and ensure decisions lead to tangible actions, GitHub Issues should be used as a tracking tool. This ensures that meeting agendas, outcomes, and follow-ups are well-documented, easily searchable, and linked to relevant discussions.

By leveraging GitHub Issues and Project Boards, we can integrate TAG decisions into workflows, making them actionable and trackable across the Aurora ecosystem.

## 1. Creating a GitHub Issue for Each TAG Meeting

Each TAG meeting should have a corresponding GitHub Issue as the single source of truth for the meeting agenda, discussions, and follow-ups.

- Before the Meeting:
  - Create a GitHub Issue titled:“Aurora TAG Meeting – YYYY-MM-DD”
  - Use the issue template (see Section 6) and pre-fill the agenda.
  - Add links to relevant OneNote, Loop pages, GitHub issues, or pre-reading materials to prepare participants.
- After the Meeting:
  - Update the same issue with a summary of key discussions, decisions, and follow-ups.
  - Convert action items into separate linked issues (see Section 3).

This ensures all TAG meetings are properly recorded in a centralized, trackable way.

---

## 2. Using Consistent Labels and Project Boards for Easy Tracking

To improve organization and searchability:

- Use a GitHub Label such as TAG-Meeting to categorize all TAG-related issues.
- If using GitHub Project Boards, create one called:
  - Aurora TAG Governance
  - Add all individual TAG meeting issues under this board.

This makes it easy to query all decisions, action items, and meeting records for long-term reference.

## 3. Sub-Issues for Action Items and Decisions

Whenever the TAG makes a decision that requires action, create a separate GitHub Issue and link it to the meeting issue using `#<issue-number>`.

- Example:
  - TAG Meeting Decision: Implement a new backup solution.
  - New Issue Created:
    - Title: “Implement backup solution X – Action from TAG 2025-04-10”
    - Assigned To: Responsible person/team
    - Due Date: Added as part of the milestone or sprint backlog

Using this approach ensures every decision has a corresponding action item that is assigned, tracked, and completed like any other GitHub Issue.

## 4. Linking to Documentation

To keep all relevant information in one place, link documentation directly in each issue:

- Meeting Notes (OneNote, Loop, SharePoint)
- Finalized meeting minutes (if published separately)
- Past TAG meeting notes for historical context

By keeping everything in the meeting issue, anyone can access full context without searching across multiple tools.

---

## 5. Integrating TAG Actions into Workflows

TAG decisions should translate into actionable work items rather than remain isolated in meeting notes.

- Best Practice:
  - Ensure that TAG-related issues appear in the Cloud Native Solutions team’s GitHub Project Board or Milestones, making them visible and trackable.
  - Link issues to relevant repositories, ensuring that decisions impact development work.
  - This mirrors how open-source projects track architecture decisions via GitHub Issues and RoADs (Records of Architectural Decisions).

By integrating TAG actions into existing workflows, they remain visible beyond the meeting itself.

## 6. Recommended GitHub Issue Template

### Title

- Aurora TAG Meeting – YYYY-MM-DD

### Description

### Overview

- Short introduction or goal of the meeting.

### Agenda

- Copy the agenda bullet points (from the meeting template).

### Next Meeting Agenda Items

- Placeholder for items earmarked for discussion in the next session.

### Action Items and Records of Architectural Decisions (RoADs)

- List action items with assigned owners and due dates.

### Links

- OneNote, SharePoint, past meeting notes, or other references.
