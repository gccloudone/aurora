{{< translation-note >}}

For any significant changes to Aurora’s architecture, a structured and transparent decision-making process is essential. The Architectural Enhancement Proposal (AEP) framework provides a consistent approach to documenting, evaluating, and approving architectural changes, ensuring that all decisions are well-informed, traceable, and aligned with organizational goals.

The AEP model draws inspiration from industry best practices, including the Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) and the Cloud Native Platform Enhancement (CNPE) process used in CNCF communities. These frameworks have proven to be effective in managing large-scale architectural decisions and fostering collaboration among stakeholders.

## AEP Template and Structure

### 1. Title and ID

- Each proposal must have a clear and unique title with a tracking ID for reference.
  - Example: “AEP-001: Adopt New Logging Framework”
- The ID should be used consistently in GitHub tickets, meeting minutes, and documentation to ensure traceability.

---

### 2. Authors and Date

- Include the name(s) of the proposer(s) and the submission date.
- If a TAG member is sponsoring the proposal, their name should be listed as well.

---

### 3. Status

- Track the current state of the proposal:
  - Draft – Initial version, open for discussion.
  - Under Review – Actively being evaluated by TAG.
  - Approved – Accepted for implementation.
  - Rejected – Decision made not to proceed (with documented reasons).
  - Deferred – Postponed for later review due to dependencies or other priorities.

---

### 4. Summary

- A concise, one-paragraph overview of the proposal, outlining:
  - The intended change
  - The problem being addressed
  - The expected benefits or impact

---

### 5. Background and Motivation

- Clearly define the problem or opportunity driving this proposal.
- Provide context on the current state and any limitations that necessitate the change.
- Consider external factors such as:
  - Compliance with Government of Canada (GoC) cybersecurity policies
  - Performance bottlenecks
  - Operational inefficiencies
  - Scalability concerns
- This section should effectively communicate why the proposed change is important.

## 6. Detailed Proposal (Core Section)

### 📌 Design Details

- Explain how the new solution or architectural change will work.
- Include technical diagrams, architecture flowcharts, or design documents if applicable.

### 📌 Components Affected

- Identify which systems, applications, or services will be impacted.
- Highlight any required changes to existing dependencies or integrations with third-party systems.

### 📌 Pros, Cons, and Alternatives

- Pros: Key benefits and why this approach is preferred.
- Cons: Potential challenges, risks, and trade-offs.
- Alternatives Considered: If other approaches were evaluated, explain why they were ruled out.

### 📌 Implications and Considerations

- Security: Will this introduce new risks or enhance security posture?
- Compliance: Does this align with GoC cybersecurity and regulatory requirements?
- Operational Impact: Will this require new skills, training, or additional maintenance effort?
- Cost and Resource Estimates: If applicable, provide an estimate of the financial or personnel impact.

### 📌 Impact on Stakeholders

- Define who is affected by this change, including:
  - Development teams
  - Security teams
  - Operations teams
  - End-users or business stakeholders
- Outline responsibilities for implementation and ongoing management.

### 📌 Dependencies

- Identify any pre-existing conditions or projects that may impact or be impacted by this proposal.
  - Example: If adopting a tool requires procurement approval or an exemption from an existing policy, note it here.

### 📌 Timeline (Optional but Recommended)

- If time-sensitive, include expected milestones such as:
  - Proof of Concept (PoC) completion date
  - Implementation timeline
  - Review checkpoints

## 7. Record of Discussion

- This section logs all TAG discussions related to the proposal.
- Capture:
  - Key points raised
  - Concerns or objections
  - Requests for additional information
  - Changes made in response to feedback
- This serves as change history to track how the proposal evolved.

---

## 8. Decision (Outcome)

- Once the TAG reaches a decision, this section is formally updated with the outcome:
  - ✅ Approved – Decision date and vote tally (if applicable).
  - ❌ Rejected – Documented reasons for non-approval.
  - ⏳ Deferred – Explanation for postponement.
- Approved AEPs should be referenced in official meeting minutes and logged in the Record of Architectural Decision (RoAD).

---

## Storage and Traceability

To ensure that all proposals are easily accessible and auditable, AEPs should be stored in a version-controlled repository or a shared document library.

Options for managing AEPs include:

- Git Repositories: Using merge requests to track discussions and changes.
- SharePoint or Confluence: For internal document control and historical records.

By maintaining a centralized repository, the TAG ensures:

- Historical traceability of architectural decisions.
- Documenting rejected proposals to provide insight into past considerations.
- A consistent and structured approach for future architecture enhancements.
