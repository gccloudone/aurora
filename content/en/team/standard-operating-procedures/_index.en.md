The Aurora initiative spans multiple teams, environments, and responsibilities. To maintain clarity and consistency, we define a set of **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for common workflows, technical conventions, and collaboration practices.

SOPs ensure that everyone — from platform engineers to partner departments — can work with a shared understanding of how we operate.

## Current SOPs

Here are the current procedures in place:

- [Issue & PR Naming Conventions](/docs/standard-operating-procedures/issue-naming/): Standardized naming and labeling for tracking work.

> SOPs are living documents. If you spot something that needs updating or expanding, please open an issue or contact the Aurora Product Office.
