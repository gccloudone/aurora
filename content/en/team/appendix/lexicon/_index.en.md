To align vocabulary and ensure clarity and consistency in documents and discussions, this Lexicon has been developed for the Aurora Team and Technical Advisory Group(s). Where applicable, the Lexicon will align with broader organizational terminology standards to maintain consistency across the higher organizational structure. Its creation and coordination will support cohesive definitions of concepts used within GC Cloud One and related initiatives.

Some terms included in this Lexicon may be sourced from [Termium Plus](https://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/) or its successor, the [Language Navigator](https://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/en/navigateur-navigator). New terms should be proposed to the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to establish a shared baseline understanding and to promote alignment across key stakeholders.

## Platform

### Aurora

Aurora is a carefully curated selection of key components from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), designed to run seamlessly on managed Kubernetes (K8s) offerings in public cloud environments as well as OpenStack in private cloud deployments. It also represents a strategic alignment between open-source and proprietary solutions, enabling flexibility and interoperability across cloud environments.ted by federal departments, providing a flexible foundation that supports diverse operational and organizational needs.

#### Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are groups of developers who share a common interest, goal, and/or problem set within a larger community. In the context of the Aurora team, SIGs are comprised of experts who collaborate to develop and improve the Aurora Platform.

#### Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs)

Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) are communities of practice that focus on specific technical domains or areas of expertise within the larger Aurora team. TAGs bring together thought leaders, practitioners, and specialists who provide guidance, define best practices, and drive innovation to support and enhance the Aurora Platform. These groups play a key role in ensuring that technical decisions align with the overall goals and standards of the community.

### Solution Builder

The term "Solution Builder" encompasses both traditional Information Technology (IT) users, such as application developers, and non-traditional IT users, including data scientists and data analysts. The use of the term "solution" instead of "app" or "system" reflects the diverse range of offerings that can be created or utilized within Aurora. These solutions can vary in scale, from large, enterprise-level initiatives supporting corporate priorities to smaller, standalone tools designed for specific, targeted purposes.

### Horizontal Services

Shared, enterprise-ready services operated centrally within Aurora. These services (e.g., Artifactory, Vault, GitLab, Backstage, Argo CD) are designed to reduce duplication across departments while providing secure and compliant building blocks for solution development.

### Citizen Developer

The term Citizen Developer, originating from collaboration among Data Scientists, refers to individuals who create or customize software programs or applications to meet specific user needs and improve operational efficiency. These developers typically lack formal programming training but use accessible tools to build solutions quickly and help IT meet increasing demands with fewer resources. While their roles differ from traditional IT positions, they often work within IT departments, bridging the gap between technical teams and end users. Within Aurora, citizen developers are considered part of the broader category of Solution Builders and are frequently referenced during divisional meetings and activities.  

## Support  

### Operational Support

Operational support covers the day-to-day management and maintenance of the Aurora Platform. This includes tasks such as namespace creation, access control, node and platform troubleshooting, and routine platform maintenance. All operational and support requests are submitted through Helix.  

### Application Support  

Application support focuses on assisting application teams with areas outside the core platform components. This includes support for CI/CD setup, Helm chart management, application architecture guidance, and related tasks. All application support requests are also submitted through Helix.
