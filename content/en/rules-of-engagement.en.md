## Purpose

The Aurora initiative is a collaborative effort that brings together diverse stakeholders across the Government of Canada. To ensure a productive, inclusive, and respectful environment, we are committed to fostering a community guided by shared values and principles.

## Our Commitment

Aurora adheres to both of the following code of ethics:

* [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)
* [Canadian Public Service Values and Ethics Code](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25049)

These frameworks emphasize inclusivity, respect, collaboration, and integrity. By participating in the Aurora community, you agree to uphold these principles in all interactions, whether online or in person.

## Key Principles

- **Be Respectful:** Treat everyone with courtesy and respect, valuing diverse perspectives and experiences.
- **Collaborate Constructively:** Engage in discussions and feedback that are solution-oriented and focused on the initiative's goals.
- **Champion Inclusivity:** Ensure that all community members feel welcome and supported, regardless of their background or expertise.
- **Adhere to Standards:** Follow established processes and policies when contributing to Aurora, ensuring alignment with organizational goals.
- **Act with Integrity:** Uphold the highest ethical standards, as outlined in the Canadian Public Service Values and Ethics Code.

## Reporting and Support
