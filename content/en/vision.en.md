## Vision

Aurora aims to unify open source and proprietary Kubernetes environments, offering a standardized and scalable platform across public and private clouds while enabling workload mobility without requiring architectural changes, and serving as a common foundation for a wide range of Government of Canada digital services.

## Overview

Aurora is designed as a cloud agnostic platform that supports teams looking to adopt cloud first design patterns across diverse environments.

This capability is delivered through a service offering referred to as the Aurora Application Hosting Platform (AUR), which provides a consistent foundation for hosting and operating solutions.

To articulate the benefits, goals, and intended outcomes of Aurora, a product vision board has been developed.

> The product vision board provides a shared understanding of the intended direction of Aurora and helps guide decision making.

## Anatomy of the Product Vision Board

![Product Vision](/images/vision/product-vision.png "Product Vision")

The product vision board consists of five sections.

1. **Vision:** the goal to be achieved
1. **Target Group:** the group most likely to benefit from using the product
1. **Needs:** the benefits provided by the product
1. **Product:** the key features of the product
1. **Business Goals:** benefits to the organisation

### Goals

By 2028, Aurora will be the cornerstone of application hosting for Canada’s federal government, supporting departments through a secure, cloud agnostic platform designed for innovation and operational excellence. It will streamline onboarding through self service capabilities, ensure consistent governance across diverse environments, and support a community of certified architects and solution builders. By enabling workloads to move between environments without redesign, Aurora allows departments to operate solutions where it makes the most technical, financial, or operational sense while avoiding unnecessary duplication and cost.

### Target Group

"Solution builders" is an umbrella term that includes traditional Information Technology (IT) users, such as application developers, as well as non traditional IT users, such as data scientists and data analysts.

The term "solution" is used instead of "app" or "system" to reflect the range of solutions supported by Aurora. This includes large scale solutions for corporate initiatives as well as smaller, standalone solutions serving specific purposes.

### Needs

There are six key benefits of using Aurora.

1. **Self service solutions**
Enable solution builders to manage their solutions independently while operating within defined guardrails.

1. **Platform handled cross cutting concerns**
Reduce the responsibility placed on application teams by handling common concerns at the platform level, including transport security and application authentication.

1. **Consistent infrastructure configuration**
Reduce ambiguity and confusion through consistent infrastructure configuration across environments.

1. **Reduced manual intervention**
Consistent infrastructure configuration minimizes the need for manual intervention during deployments.

1. **Rapid and consistent deployments**
Automation enables deployments to be performed quickly and consistently.

1. **Packaged documentation with the solution**
Provide tooling that ensures documentation is delivered alongside the solution and remains current.

### Product

There are five key features of the Aurora Platform.

1. **Built in security**
Security features such as platform managed TLS, application authentication, disaster recovery, data protection, integration with enterprise security tooling, and network security policies.

1. **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) services and technology**
Aurora promotes cloud agnostic infrastructure built on cloud first designs and open source technologies. The majority of platform components align with CNCF projects.

1. **Scalable and resilient services**
Platform services are designed to scale based on the demands of the solutions they host.

1. **Inherent observability**
Provides insight into platform and solution behaviour to support troubleshooting and operational awareness.

1. **On demand infrastructure provisioning**
Infrastructure is provisioned using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure consistency across compute, network, and storage resources.

### Business Goals

The benefits of the Aurora Platform to Shared Services Canada include the following.

1. **IT spending targeted to needs**
Infrastructure resources are provisioned based on demand rather than maintained in advance.

1. **Cost optimization through workload mobility**
Solutions can move between cloud and on premise environments without architectural change, allowing departments to optimize for cost, performance, and operational requirements.

1. **Increased visibility into IT consumption costs**
Tooling provides insight into resource usage and cost efficiency at the solution level.

1. **Reduced lead time from development to deployment**
Supports early deployment and iterative delivery, enabling teams to validate direction quickly.

1. **Support for open source and DevSecOps practices**
Aligns with the Government of Canada Digital Standards and supports closer collaboration between development and operations teams.
