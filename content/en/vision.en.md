## Vision

Aurora aims to unify the best of both worlds open-source and proprietary Kubernetes environments, offering a standardized, scalable, and secure hosting solution.

## Overview

One of the goals of the Aurora team is to design and build a cloud agnostic platform that supports teams looking to take advantage of "cloud-first" designs.

To achieve this, the Aurora team provides a service offering known as the Aurora Application Hosting Platform (AUR).

To highlight the benefits, goals and purpose of Aurora the Aurora team has created a product vision board.

The product vision board is used to provide a common understanding of the direction to move towards and it guides and informs decisions regarding Aurora.

## Anatomy of the Product Vision Board

The product vision board consists of five sections.

1. **Vision:** the goal we want to achieve
1. **Target Group:** the group most likely to benefit from the using the product
1. **Needs:** the provided benefit of using the product
1. **Product:** key features of the product
1. **Business Goals:** benefits to the organisation

### Goals

By 2028, Aurora will be the cornerstone of application hosting for Canada’s federal government, uniting departments under a secure, cloud-agnostic platform designed for innovation and operational excellence. It will streamline the onboarding process with intuitive self-service capabilities, ensure consistent governance across diverse environments, and empower a community of certified architects and solution builders to drive digital transformation. By prioritizing scalability, security, and interoperability, Aurora will redefine how government solutions are developed, deployed, and managed, fostering collaboration and setting a new benchmark for modern public-sector technology platforms.

### Target Group

"Solution builders" is the umbrella term that encompasses both traditional Information Technology (IT) users, such as application developers as well as non-traditional IT users, such as data scientists and data analysts. The term "solution" is used instead "app" or "system" to better reflect the range of solutions that could be available on Aurora. For example, this can include large-scale solutions for corporate initiatives as well as smaller solutions that may be standalone and serve very specific purposes.

### Needs

There are five key benefits of using Aurora:

1. **Self-service solutions**
Enable solution builders to have more autonomy over their solutions and enforce the self-serve model with appropriate guardrails.
1. **Consistent infrastructure configuration**
Reduce ambiguity and confusion with infrastructure configuration across environments.
1. **Reduce manual intervention**
A benefit of consistent infrastructure configurations is the reduction in manual intervention during deployments.
1. **Rapid and consistent deployments**
With consistent infrastructure and reduced manual interventions, deployments can be automated and performed quickly and consistently.
1. **Package documention with the solution**
Provide tooling that packages the documentation with the solution ensures this vital information is not decoupled.

### Product

There are five key features of the Aurora Platform:

1. **Built-in security**: Security features such as disaster recovery, data security, integration with the corporate security information and event management tools and networking security policies.

1. **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) services and technology**: The Aurora Platform is proponent of modern, cloud agnostic infrastructure systems powered by cloud-first designs and open source software. The majority of the components on the Aurora Platform are technologies promoted by the CNCF.

1. **Scalable and resilient services**: Services and components on the platform that can scale to the demands of solutions it hosts.

1. **Inherent observability**: Enables a better understanding and insight into why something went wrong.

1. **On-demand infrastructure provisioning**: Through the promotion of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) infrastructure can be provisioned consistently and in accordance with compute, network, and storage needs.

### Business Goals

The benefits of the Aurura Platform to Shared Services Canada include:

1. **IT spending targeted to needs**: Rather than pay for infrastructure that may sit dormant, it can be targeted when needed.

1. **Increased visibility into IT consumption costs**: Available tooling that provides more insight into a solution's consumption costs including how efficient a solution is utilizing its resources.

1. **Reduce lead-time for development to deployment**: Promote the concept of "fail fast" so that solutions can be deployed on Day 0 to enable early realization of success or failure and allowing solution builders teams to pivot in the right direction.

1. **Empower the cultural shift to open source and DevSecOps**: Align with the [Government of Canada Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html) and break the silos within IT (dev and operations).
