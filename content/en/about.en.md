Aurora is a secure, cloud-native application hosting platform built by departments for departments across the Government of Canada.

Part of the GC Cloud One initiative, Aurora simplifies solution delivery by providing a consistent Kubernetes-based foundation across public and private cloud environments.

Our mission is to enable secure, scalable, and interoperable digital servicesâ€”driven by community, guided by standards, and built on operational experience.
