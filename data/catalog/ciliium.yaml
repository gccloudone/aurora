descriptions:
  short: "Cilium provides Kubernetes networking and NetworkPolicy enforcement using an eBPF dataplane."
  long: >-
    Cilium is Aurora’s primary Container Network Interface (CNI) and dataplane for
    Kubernetes workload clusters. It leverages eBPF to deliver high-performance
    pod networking, fine-grained network policy enforcement, and deep traffic
    observability through Hubble. Cilium enables advanced networking patterns,
    including ClusterwideNetworkPolicy and optional BGP-based route advertisement
    to integrate pod and service networking with enterprise firewalls.
