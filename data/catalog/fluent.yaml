descriptions:
  short: "Fluent Bit is a lightweight log processor and forwarder for Kubernetes and cloud-native environments."
  long: >-
    Fluent Bit is used within Aurora as the primary log collection and forwarding
    agent for Kubernetes clusters. It runs as a DaemonSet on worker nodes,
    collecting container and system logs, enriching them with Kubernetes
    metadata, and forwarding them to centralized logging backends. Fluent Bit
    provides a lightweight, high-performance logging pipeline that supports
    multi-tenant environments and standardized observability practices across
    the platform.
