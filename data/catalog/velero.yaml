descriptions:
  short: "Velero provides backup, restore, and disaster recovery for Kubernetes resources."
  long: >-
    Velero is used by Aurora to provide backup and restore capabilities for
    Kubernetes clusters and their associated resources. It enables disaster
    recovery, cluster migration, and operational resilience by capturing the
    state of Kubernetes objects and, where supported, persistent volume data.
    Velero supports scheduled and on-demand backups and integrates with
    cloud object storage to retain backups outside the cluster lifecycle.

  - backup
  - restore
  - disaster-recovery

architecture:
  role: >-
    Provides cluster-level backup and restore functionality by interacting with
    the Kubernetes API server to capture and rehydrate resource state. Velero
    coordinates backup operations and stores backup metadata and artifacts in
    external object storage, enabling recovery even in the event of complete
    cluster loss.
