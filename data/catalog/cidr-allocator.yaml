  long: >-
    CIDR Allocator is a custom Aurora platform component responsible for
    allocating, tracking, and managing IP address ranges for Kubernetes
    clusters and networking domains. It ensures that cluster, pod, and
    service CIDRs are assigned deterministically and without overlap across
    environments. CIDR Allocator enables scalable multi-cluster networking,
    simplifies routing and firewall integration, and supports Aurora’s
    zero-trust and multi-cloud networking architecture.

architecture:
  role: >-
    Acts as a centralized control-plane service that allocates CIDR blocks
    from predefined address pools and records assignments for Kubernetes
    clusters. CIDR Allocator integrates with cluster provisioning workflows
    and downstream networking components to ensure consistent IP addressing
    across clusters, clouds, and connectivity boundaries.
