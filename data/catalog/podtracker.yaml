descriptions:
  short: "PodTracker records and exposes Kubernetes pod metadata for platform-level visibility and automation."
  long: >-
    PodTracker is a custom Aurora platform component that observes Kubernetes
    pod lifecycle events and records authoritative metadata about running
    workloads. It provides a reliable source of truth for pod identity,
    ownership, namespace context, and runtime attributes. PodTracker enables
    downstream automation and integration use cases, including networking,
    security, observability, and audit workflows, by making pod-level metadata
    consistently available outside the cluster.

architecture:
  role: >-
    Acts as a Kubernetes-native controller that watches pod lifecycle events
    and extracts metadata from the Kubernetes API. PodTracker normalizes and
    persists pod information and exposes it to other platform services and
    automation pipelines, enabling consistent cross-cutting concerns such as
    networking policy enforcement, observability correlation, and security
    analysis.
