descriptions:
  short: "Tetragon provides real-time runtime security enforcement and tracing for Kubernetes using eBPF."
  long: >-
    Tetragon is used within Aurora to provide real-time runtime security
    enforcement and deep system observability for Kubernetes workloads using
    eBPF. It enables policy-driven detection and prevention of undesired process,
    file, and network activity at the kernel level, without requiring application
    instrumentation. Tetragon complements admission-time controls and passive
    detection by enabling active enforcement and fine-grained runtime policy
    aligned with zero-trust and defense-in-depth security models.

    Acts as the runtime enforcement and tracing layer for Kubernetes workloads,
    observing and optionally blocking process execution, file access, and
    network activity using eBPF programs attached to kernel hooks.
