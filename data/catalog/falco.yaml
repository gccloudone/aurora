descriptions:
  short: "Falco provides runtime threat detection for containers and Kubernetes workloads."
  long: >-
    Falco is used within Aurora to provide runtime security monitoring and threat
    detection for Kubernetes workloads. It observes system calls and Kubernetes
    events to detect abnormal or potentially malicious behavior, such as
    privilege escalation, unexpected process execution, or suspicious network
    activity. Falco enables real-time alerting and supports policy-driven runtime
    enforcement aligned with zero-trust and defense-in-depth security models.

    Acts as the primary runtime threat detection engine for Kubernetes workloads
    by monitoring system-level activity and evaluating it against security rules
    to identify suspicious or non-compliant behavior.
