descriptions:
  short: "Istio provides service mesh capabilities for traffic management, security, and observability in Kubernetes."
  long: >-
    Istio is used within Aurora to provide service mesh capabilities for
    Kubernetes workloads, including traffic management, mutual TLS, identity-
    aware authorization, and service-to-service observability. It enables
    fine-grained control over east-west traffic and supports zero-trust
    networking patterns by enforcing strong identity and policy at the
    application layer, complementing lower-level network controls provided by
    the CNI.

architecture:
  role: >-
    Acts as the application-layer traffic management and security control plane
    for Kubernetes workloads. Istio provides identity, encryption, routing, and
    policy enforcement for service-to-service communication within and across
    namespaces.
