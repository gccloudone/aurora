descriptions:
  short: "Trust Manager distributes and manages trusted CA bundles across Kubernetes workloads."
  long: >-
    Trust Manager is used by Aurora to centrally manage and distribute trusted
    certificate authority (CA) bundles across Kubernetes clusters and workloads.
    It enables consistent trust configuration for platform and application
    components by synchronizing CA certificates into Kubernetes-native resources.
    Trust Manager reduces configuration drift, simplifies certificate trust
    management, and supports secure service-to-service communication in
    zero-trust and enterprise environments.

architecture:
  role: >-
    Acts as a cluster-level controller that reconciles trusted certificate
    sources into Kubernetes resources such as ConfigMaps and Secrets. Trust
    Manager integrates with cert-manager and other certificate authorities to
    ensure workloads have access to up-to-date trust bundles required for secure
    communication.
