descriptions:
  short: "Fluent Operator is a Kubernetes operator that manages Fluent Bit deployments for log collection and forwarding."
  long: >-
    Fluent Operator is used within Aurora as the control plane for Kubernetes
    logging. It manages the lifecycle, configuration, and rollout of Fluent Bit
    instances across clusters using Kubernetes custom resources. By separating
    log pipeline configuration from node-level agents, Fluent Operator enables
    consistent, declarative, and multi-tenant logging practices while reducing
    operational complexity for platform and application teams.

architecture:
  role: >-
    Acts as the logging control plane for Kubernetes clusters. Fluent Operator
    reconciles custom resources that define log sources, filters, and outputs,
    and ensures Fluent Bit DaemonSets are deployed and configured consistently
    across nodes and namespaces.
