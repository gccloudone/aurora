descriptions:
  short: "Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes."
  long: >-
    Argo CD is Aurora’s primary GitOps engine for deploying and managing platform
    and application components across Kubernetes clusters. It continuously
    reconciles the desired state defined in Git repositories with the live state
    of clusters, providing drift detection, automated synchronization, and
    auditable change history. Argo CD enables consistent, repeatable deployments
    while enforcing separation of concerns between platform teams and application
    teams.

capabilities:
  - gitops
  - continuous-delivery
  - configuration-management
