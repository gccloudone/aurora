descriptions:
  short: "Trivy Operator provides continuous security scanning for Kubernetes workloads and cluster resources."
  long: >-
    Trivy Operator is used by Aurora to perform continuous, automated security
    scanning of Kubernetes workloads, container images, and cluster
    configurations. It integrates Trivy’s vulnerability, misconfiguration,
    and compliance scanning capabilities directly into the Kubernetes control
    plane by producing Kubernetes-native custom resources. Trivy Operator
    enables proactive risk identification, supports supply chain security
    objectives, and provides visibility into security posture across
    Aurora-managed clusters.

capabilities:
  - vulnerability-scanning
  - configuration-scanning
  - compliance-reporting
  - supply-chain-security
  - kubernetes-native-security

architecture:
  role: >-
    Runs as a Kubernetes operator that continuously scans cluster resources
    and workloads for security issues. Trivy Operator executes scans using
    Trivy scanners and records findings as Kubernetes custom resources,
    enabling integration with policy engines, dashboards, and security
    workflows without blocking cluster operation.
