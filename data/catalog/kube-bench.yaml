  long: >-
    kube-bench is used by Aurora to assess Kubernetes clusters against
    the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Kubernetes Benchmarks. It
    evaluates cluster configuration, control plane components, and
    node-level settings to identify deviations from recommended security
    baselines. kube-bench supports compliance reporting, security posture
    assessments, and continuous improvement of cluster hardening across
    Aurora-managed environments.

architecture:
  role: >-
    Executes benchmark checks against Kubernetes control plane and node
    components by inspecting configuration files, command-line flags,
    and runtime settings. kube-bench runs periodically or on demand and
    produces machine-readable reports that can be consumed by security
    dashboards and compliance workflows.
