descriptions:
  short: "Hubble provides network flow observability for Kubernetes using eBPF."
  long: >-
    Hubble is the observability component of Cilium that provides deep visibility
    into Kubernetes network traffic using eBPF. It captures network flows at the
    kernel level and exposes them through APIs, CLI tools, and a web-based UI.
    Within Aurora, Hubble enables platform operators and application teams to
    understand service-to-service communication, troubleshoot connectivity
    issues, and validate network policy behavior without packet capture or
    intrusive instrumentation.

    Provides real-time network flow observability by consuming eBPF events
    emitted by the Cilium dataplane and exposing them through the Hubble API,
    CLI, and UI.
