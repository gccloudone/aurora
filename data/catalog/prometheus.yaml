descriptions:
  short: "Prometheus provides metrics collection, storage, and querying for Kubernetes and cloud-native systems."
  long: >-
    Prometheus is used within Aurora as the primary metrics collection and
    querying system for Kubernetes clusters and platform services. It scrapes
    metrics from workloads, infrastructure components, and platform services,
    storing time-series data that enables monitoring, alerting, and performance
    analysis. Prometheus forms the foundation of Aurora’s observability stack
    and supports standardized metrics-based visibility across multi-tenant
    environments.
