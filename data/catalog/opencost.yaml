descriptions:
  short: "OpenCost provides real-time cost allocation and visibility for Kubernetes workloads."
  long: >-
    OpenCost is used within Aurora to provide transparent, real-time visibility
    into the cost of running Kubernetes workloads. It allocates infrastructure
    and cloud resource costs to namespaces, workloads, and labels, enabling
    platform operators and client teams to understand consumption patterns,
    support chargeback or showback models, and make informed decisions about
    resource usage. OpenCost promotes financial accountability while remaining
    vendor-neutral and aligned with open-source cost management practices.
