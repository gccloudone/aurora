  short: "Gatekeeper enforces policy and governance controls in Kubernetes using OPA."
  long: >-
    Gatekeeper is used within Aurora as the Kubernetes admission controller for
    enforcing policy and governance controls at resource creation and update
    time. Built on Open Policy Agent (OPA), Gatekeeper enables policy-as-code
    enforcement for security, compliance, and platform guardrails, ensuring that
    Kubernetes resources adhere to approved standards before they are admitted
    into the cluster. This approach reduces operational risk and supports
    consistent enforcement of enterprise and regulatory requirements.

    templates and policies before resources are persisted.
