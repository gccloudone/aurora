descriptions:
  short: "cert-manager automates the management and renewal of TLS certificates in Kubernetes."
  long: >-
    cert-manager is used within Aurora to automate the issuance, renewal, and
    lifecycle management of TLS certificates for Kubernetes workloads and
    platform services. It integrates with external certificate authorities and
    internal PKI systems to ensure secure, policy-compliant encryption for
    ingress, service-to-service communication, and platform endpoints, reducing
    operational risk and manual certificate handling.
